# scale-chords-generator

This is a console-based app that generates a musical scale and its associated tertian chords from an inputted tonic note and mode of scale. 

This program will not accommodate exotic or theoretical keys (such as G# Major), which contain double sharps or double flats. Only the Major and Minor keys established in the Circle of Fifths are accepted.
